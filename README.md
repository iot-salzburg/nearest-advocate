This repository contains the source code, demo data, research experiments as well as benchmarking of the code and is based on the Github-Repository [iot-salzburg/nearest-advocate](https://github.com/iot-salzburg/nearest-advocate).


## Scope of the package

This package focuses on the time delay estimation between two event-based time-series that are relatively shifted by an unknown time offset. An event-based time-series is given by a set of timestamps of certain events.
If you want to guarantee synchronous measurements in advance or estimate the time delay of continuous measurements sampled at a constant rate, you might want to use other methods.
However, in some use cases, performing an event detection and then estimating the relative time delay has advantages.
The Nearest Advocate method provides a **precise time delay estimation in event-based time-series** that is **robust against imprecise timestamps, a high fraction of missing events, and clock drift**.


## Quickstart

Install the package with:

```bash
pip install nearest_advocate
```

Open Python and import and use it for time delay estimation of event-based time-series:

```python
import numpy as np
import nearest_advocate
```

Create a reference array whose inter-event intervals are sampled from a normal distribution. The signal array is a clone of the referenceÂ´, shifted by `np.pi` and added Gaussian noise. The event's timestamps of both arrays must be sorted.

```python
arr_ref = np.sort(np.cumsum(np.random.normal(loc=1, scale=0.25, size=1000)))
arr_sig = np.sort(arr_ref + np.pi + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=0.1, size=1000))
```

The function `nearest_advocate.nearest_advocate` returns a two-columned array with all investigated time-shifts and their mean distances, i.e., the measure of the synchronicity between both arrays (lower is better).

```python
time_shifts = nearest_advocate.nearest_advocate(arr_ref=arr_ref, arr_sig=arr_sig, td_min=-60, td_max=60, sps=20)
time_shift, min_mean_dist = time_shifts[np.argmin(time_shifts[:,1])]
print(f"Found an optimum at {time_shift:.4f}s with a minimal mean distance of {min_mean_dist:.6f}s")
#> Found an optimum at 3.15s with a minimal mean distance of 0.079508s
```
The time delay estimation is 3.15 seconds which is pretty close to the true one.
Create a plot of the resulting characteristic curve of Nearest Advocate, the global minimum of the curve is used as time delay estimation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(time_shifts[:,0], time_shifts[:,1], color="steelblue", label="Mean distance")
plt.vlines(x=time_shift, ymin=min_mean_dist, ymax=np.mean(time_shifts[:,1]), color="firebrick", label=f"Shift = {time_shift:.2f}s")
plt.xlim(time_shift-4, time_shift+4)
plt.xlabel("Time delay (s)")
plt.ylabel("Mean distance (s)")
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
```

## Building from source

### Setup

```bash
cd /go/to/path
git clone https://github.com/iot-salzburg/nearest-advocate
cd nearest-advocate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For reproducibility, the experiments were run in Python 3.9 inside a container environment using the Docker orchestration software with the image `cschranz/gpu-jupyter` and tag `v1.4\_cuda-11.0\_ubuntu-20.04`, available on Dockerhub.

Build the Cython-version of the algorithm with:

```bash
cd src
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```


### Run the tests

Currently, the Cython-version is under development and will be available soon.

Run the test scripts:

```bash
python tests/test_algorithm.py
#> Testing numba-version:          ok
#> Testing Cython-version:         ok
#> Testing Python-version:         ok
